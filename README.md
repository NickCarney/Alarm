# Alarm
Alarm app that has different daily functions. Made to help hone my web skills.

Mainly uses js and html, and includes other technologies such as mysql, node.js, and express. 
Home page that displays live time and date, alarm page that has a photo and sound for when you wake up, as well as a snooze button and other functionality. 
There is a 'daily' page that shows a daily fact, quote, vocab word, and 'challenge'.
